Pointshop Rupee Addon
=====================

It does stuff with a player's points depending on some stuff.

Note
----

This started out to replace an addon that did the same thing (I never even implemented the HUD thing that was wanted from it lol). This was a in early 2014 when I was getting started with Lua so this slowly grew into a giant ball of shit that I just kept expanding on. It isn't really useful for anything but TTT since no other gamemodes have support.

(super secret note) this was originally named ps_rupee_addon since I couldn't think of anything but I'm renaming it to psra.

I have no idea who made any of the model or vgui/rupee_material stuff. I also need to add licenses for anything that's needed (fonts, materials, models, etc).

Todo
